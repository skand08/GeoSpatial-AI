GeoSpatial Analysis and Deep Learning


1. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm designed for processing visual data. They're adept at tasks like image recognition by using specialized layers to automatically and hierarchically learn patterns and features from images.

2. Deep learning dataset preparation
Using ArcGIS Pro, you can organize and prepare geospatial datasets for deep learning tasks, while open-source methods like the GeoTile Python library offer alternative approaches to preprocess spatial data for deep learning models.


3. Land Use Land Cover Classification
Image classification involves categorizing images based on their content, like distinguishing different land use and land cover types (e.g., forests, urban areas) within satellite or aerial imagery.

4. Building detection (image segmentation)
Image segmentation focuses on dividing an image into meaningful parts or segments. In the context of building detection, this technique delineates building boundaries within satellite or aerial imagery.

5. Flood mapping using Attention UNet
Flood mapping using Attention U-Net involves employing a specialized neural network architecture called Attention U-Net for the purpose of accurately detecting and mapping flooded areas within images or remote sensing data. The Attention U-Net model integrates the U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms, allowing it to focus on important regions while processing the data. This technique helps enhance the model's ability to distinguish between flooded and non-flooded areas by selectively attending to critical features in the imagery, thereby improving the accuracy of flood mapping and aiding in disaster response and management efforts.
